I used Python modules like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib in my project to analyse data from the Indian Premier League (IPL). The information includes player-level information like batting and bowling statistics as well as match-level information like venue, winner, and scores for IPL games played between 2008 and 2017. The data covers matches from the 2008 to 2017 season.

The main goal of my analysis is to examine many facets of IPL games, such as the effectiveness of specific players, teams, and locations. To remove any incomplete or unnecessary data, I employed data cleaning techniques. 


In this analysis, I address several important issues like the following:

Which team has had the best IPL record of performance?

What relationship exists between a team winning and winning the toss?

Who has been the most valuable player (MVP) in the history of the IPL?

Overall, this project offers a thorough and analytical examination of IPL data that might be helpful to both cricket fans and data professionals. I've tried to make the findings as plain and concise as possible so that anyone can easily grasp them and benefit from the new insights. You are welcome to look through the Jupyter notebooks to discover more about the analysis procedure and the findings I came to.
